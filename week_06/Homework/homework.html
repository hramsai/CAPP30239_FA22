        <h1>Reading Police Killings in 2015</h1>
        <p>The data used for these charts come from the Washington Post.</p>
        <h3>At the outset, a Racial Distribution of the Killings:</h3>
        <div id="bar_chart">
        </div>
        <p>As the chart shows, 26% of the deceased are Black. It also shows that over 50% of those killed are 'White'.
            It is important, however, it note that the population distribution tells a different story.
        </p>

        <h3>The Populations Distribution</h3>
        <div id="another_chart">
        </div>
        <p>As the chart shows, only 13% of the population identifies as 'Black'. This shows that the killings are disproportionately of black people. 
        </p>

        <h3>Number of Killings Across the Year</h3>
        <div id="line_chart">
        </div>
        <p> This chart shows the distribution of total killings through the months of 2015. As is evident, we see a slight dip in the summer months, and an increase in July and August.

        <h3> Distribution of How People were Killed</h3>
        <p>
