### About Me: 

## Harish Ram Sai

I am a second-year MPP student at the University of Chicago, Harris School of Public Policy. I am interested in questions that lay at the intersection of gender, urban planning and international development. Working on these interests overtime, I have come to realise the use of clear data visualisations in acheiving proximal and distal policy goals. Specifically, when aiming to recitify women's public toilets in different cities in India, I felt city governments were more receptive to visual mappings as opposed to tabular statisitics. Through this class, I am hoping to hone my skills to create more meanigful and intentional visualisations, and use them to drive similar change in my home country. 

Outside my policy interests, I enjoy reading, primarily fiction from the Victorian or Regency era, and watching Bravo TV. Almost unsurprisingly, both geners, across different multimedia platforms, are fairly similar.
