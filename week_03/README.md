# CAPP 30239 - Final Project
## 'Investing in the East'

### Data source

Title: World Bank Geocoded Research <br />
Agency: AidData, William and Mary's Global Research Institute <br />
Location: United States of America <br />
Link: https://www.aiddata.org/data/world-bank-geocoded-research-release-level-1-v1-4-2 <br />

### Description of data: 

AidData's data is an extentive collection of all the projects approved from 1995-2014 in the World Bank (specifially International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and International Development Association) lending lines. According to the description on the website, the data togethers tracks more than $630 billion in commitments for 5,684 projects across 61,243 locations. 

Of interest are four datasets: 
1. locations.csv, which contains the locations for each project.
2. projects.csv, has more data on all the projects.
3. projects_ancillary.csv, which contains information about some of the ancillary projects at the Bank
4. transactions.csv, which contains information on all the transactions for each project.

### Why you are interested in this topic?

This past summer, I worked at IBRD as a Strategy Consultant with the Global Health, Nutrition and Population verticle. My work primarily entailed implementing specific programs (primarily surveys and RCTs) in different developing countries to improve health outcomes. However, through this work, it was inevitable to think about the ethics and costs of such undertakings stemming from the traditional West:
1. Some programs gave treatments only to specific people, depriving others of a potential benefits. 
2. Often, the outcome from such heavy investments weren't tangible.
3. People in these nations, even though they needed help, are reduced to mere data points. 

In many ways, I am interested in this data to test this hypothesis. At the outset, I am keeping to answer some preliminary questions: 
1. How much money is invested in internaitonal develpoment on a yearly basis?
2. What are the costs and benefits of these investments? 
3. Which areas are targetted more than others?

### Thoughts on how you would hope to use this data:

A lot of the answers to the questions I am interested in probing lies in these datasets. I am hoping to put these four datastes together to visualize the flow of money and development intervention across the globe, and see how that alters over time. 

### Potential data points

### Any concerns about the data

Some concerns I have about the data: 
1. The time frame doesn't contain one of the biggest phenomenons of our time -- the COVID-19 pandemic. 

### Identify if source is primary or secondary

### If secondary data, how you envision this data working with the primary source?
