        Investing in the East: <i>Where and How does the World Bank Invest?</i>

        The World Bank Group is an international development bank that fosters global partnerships to fight poverty worldwide through sustainable solutions. 
        Over the last three decades, the organization has committed over $630 billion across 5,684 projects and 61,243 locations towards different causes to drive their mission forward. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking at these modes of development with a keen eye, Robtel Neajai Pailey, in her article "De-centering the 'White Gaze' of Development", questions the role of these international development banks.
        She argues that “in its constant negotiation of poverty, power, politics and privilege, development continues to be structured in hierarchies of race and place” (2019). She questions the ontology of international development as a field, and expresses concern about the “internalized whiteness” with which banks aid only certain parts of the world, and few developing nations. 
        At the intersection of Pailey's concern and the Bank's large lending line is the central question of this project: <em><b>over the years, where, on what and how much has the World Bank invested to accelerate development?</b></em>

        This statistics outline the Bank's large lending lines, especially from 2004 to 2010. 
        Post that, we see a slight decline in the amount of money disbursed. 
        From over USD 100 billion in the 2010, there is a drop to close to USD 40 billion in 2012.
        A potential reason for this change might be the Great Recession, that caused an economic depression across the globe, with US as its epi-centre, from 2007 to 2009. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Important to note: the Bank, with an aim of holisitic development, diversifies the sectors that it invests their money.
        For instnace, it funds interventions that hope to drive education and empoyment as well as studies that improve acess to clean water and basic sanitation.
        While most interventions are multi-pronger, and aim to target a collective of problems as opposed to just one, they all have a "primary sector". 
        Some of their primary sectore where the Bank has invested its money includes Agriculture, Education, Energy, with Water and Sanitation being the area granted the most of funding (upwards of $140 billion). 
        Therefore, it is interesting to note the way these funds have vary not only by year, but also by sectors.

        It also outlines the time frame of the Great Recession in the United States, where the World Bank operates out of, to see its potential impact on lending lines.

        As the chart shows, The World Bank invests just under $ 8 billion in the sector "Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing", with no clear pattern over the 10 years of interest.
        There also in no visible alteration in the money spent towards interventions focussed on this sector due to the recession. 
        Perhaps this is due to its global necessity, especially during adverse economic conditions.

        The story is different for some other sectors, specifically "Banking" and "Water and Sanitation".
